# Unit Deliverable 2 - Final Project GUI

This is a GUI that will help you keep track of your characters in the hit game Lost Ark! In my experience, it happens far too often that I need to answer a question about one of my characters and I don't have the information memorized. The game takes so long to open and if I'm already actively in game, I have to back out of a game to get any information necessary, again being blocked by loading times. This program will streamline that issue and save my RAM and SSD from overworking on the regular.
